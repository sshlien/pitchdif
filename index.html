    <h2> Pitch Discrimination Tests or Exercises </h2>
<p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
Good pitch discrimination is an important asset for any person
planning to be a music performer.  String instruments which
are temperature and humidity sensitive need to retuned frequently.
Fortunately there are now tuning meters for people like me who
have trouble determining whether the note is tuned too low or high.
<p>
This program provides six different methods for measuring
one's ability to detect small pitch differences. The program
is configurable and can run on either the Windows or the Linux
operating systems. However, the program in its present state
requires some knowledge of abc music notation, the midi standard, tcl/tk,
and the computer file system.
<p>
This program was put together rather quickly in order to test
out various ideas.  To use this program you will need
Tcl/Tk 8.5 or 8.6 installed on your system, a midi player
that can run invisibly, and the executable abc2midi.
There are numerous configuration options.
<p>
The program runs in the following manner.
Each time the user clicks on a button, the program generates
a test abc file, executes abc2midi to convert it into a midi file,
and then forwards the file to a midi player.  The user responds by
selecting the tone that is different, or indicating whether
a particular tone is higher or lower relative to another tone.

Despite the complexity of the program, it  runs sufficiently
fast to be interactive.  Six exercises are included in the
program.  The results of these exercises are stored in
separate data files in a folder chosen by the user. 

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>
The frequency of a note doubles in each octave. For example,
the note A in the lower octave is 220 Hz, 440 Hz in the
middle octave, then to 880 Hz in the next octave. An octave
is divided into 12 semitones where each semitone rises in frequency
by a constant factor equal to the 12th root of two or 1.059460943.
Most people can detect pitch difference smaller than a semitone.
Here we use pitch differences measured in cents where each semitone
is divided into 100 equal parts or cents.


<h3>Exercises</h3>
Note that if you click the <b>Help</b> button after selecting
one of the exercises, brief instructions will be displayed in
a frame below.
<h4>Warble</h4>
The program plays a continous tone and slowly modulates the
pitch by a small amount. The degree of this modulation is
controlled by a slider. The goal is to set the pitch modulation to
the level where it is just audible. It is recommended that
you begin with a large modulation so you know what
to listen for. Gradually decrease the amount of modulation until
it becomes imperceptible. This is a quick way for measuring your
pitch sensitivity. You will find that it is easier to detect
modulations in the higher octaves, and if the tone is fairly
simple. The way this can be configured is described in
another section.

<h4>High/Low and Chord High/Low </h4>
In this exercise, two tones are played and your object is to
indicate whether the first tone is higher or lower in pitch
Frequently, you are aware of a difference, but are may not
be able to tell whether it is high or low. The pitch difference
varies with each trial. If you click on the <b>tools/plot</b>
menu button, a plot similar to below will be displayed.

<p>
<img src = "highlow.gif" alt = "highlow histogram">
<p>

This is a histogram of the correct (blue) and wrong
(red) responses as a function of the pitch differences.
Most of the red responses concentrate
at the smaller pitch differences (in cents). The program
continues to accumulate the results until you delete the
highlow.dat file. By default this file is found in the
folder called pitchdata.  This file (if it exists) is read
each time the program is started and is replaced on exiting
the program.

The chord high/low exercise is almost identical to the
high/low exercise. The difference is that the test tones
are now embedded in two-tone chords -- the same test tones
and  harmonizing tones.  The second tone is above or below
the test tone by a fixed number of semitones which
is set in the configuration page. The question is whether
it is easier or harder to detect the higher test tones
in this environment. The results are stored in a file
called chordhighlow.dat.


<h4>Odd One Out and Chord Odd One Out</h4>
In this exercise, four tones are played in where one of the tones
is played slightly flat or sharp. Your goal is to select the
the distinct tone by clicking on one of the 4 buttons.
Like the previous exercise, the pitch differences
vary from trial to trial and your responses are collected
and stored in the file called oddout.dat. 
A histogram similar to below is exposed when you click
on the menu item <b>tools/plot</b>.
<p>
<img src = "oddout.gif" alt = "oddout histogram">
<p>
The horizontal scale indicates pitch differences
(positive or negative) of the distinct tone.
The number of correct responses and wrong responses are
indicated in blue and red respectively for each pitch
difference.

<h4>Tuning </h4>
In this exercise, two tones are played. Your goal is to tune
the second tone using the slider so it sounds like the first
You should play the sequence using the <b>repeat</b> button
after shifting the slider. When you believe the two tones
are identical, click the button labeled <b>Done</b>.
Repeat this many times so that you have enough data
to plot.
<p>
<img src = "tuning.gif" alt = "tuning histogram">
<p>
There is no right or wrong so that all the counts are in blue.
The counts should concentrate near zero if you tune the notes
correctly. All the results are stored in the file tuning.dat.

<h3>Configuration</h3>
Clicking on the <b>cfg</b> button will display a window like this.
<p>
<img src = "cfg.gif" alt = "configuration sheet">
<p>
The <b>abc2midi</b> entry box points to the executable abc2midi.
The <b>midi player </b> entry box points to the midi player executable.
I find <b>timidity</b> works best on both Linux and Windows; however,
<b>timidity</b> requires a SoundFont file and a configuration
file <b>timidity.cfg</b> indicating where to find the SoundFont.
You can use the abc2midi and midi player buttons to navigate to these
executables.
<p>
<b>pitch in ABC notation</b> It sets the pitch of the test tone
to be played in all the exercises. The pitch is specified using the
abc music notation standard. Here are some examples:
<br>
C       Middle C
<br>
c       One octave above middle C
<br>
c'      Two octaves above middle C
<br>
C,      One octave below middle C
<br>
_B      B flat
<br>
^F      F sharp

<p>
<b>midi program (0 -127)</b> Note that not all midi programs are suitable.
The tone of some instruments may decay too fast, especially in
the high registers.  Other instruments may have too much vibrato
or tremolo. Ensemble programs are too rich. The following instruments
(midi program numbers) are recommend: 
Brass (56-63), Reed (64-71), Pipe (72-79),
and Synth Lead (80-87).
<p>
<b>tempo</b> beats per minute. Controls the duration of the tone
sequence usually consisting of 4 beat tones.
<p>
<b>maximum shift (cents)</b> and 
<b>minimum shift</b> controls the range of pitch shifts selected by
the random number generator. I recommend a range from 0 to 25.
The plots go up to 25 presently.
<p>
<b>chord interval (semitones)</b> For the exercises chord high/low and
chord odd one out, this parameter determines the pitch of the chordal
tone which is played either above or below the test tone.
<p>
<b>data folder</b> This is the folder where the data files highlow.dat,
oddout.dat and tuning.dat. By default it is pitchdata; however, if you
want to save the results for different configurations (eg. different pitch,
or different midi program), or different users, you can use different names.
<p>
I do not recommend changing the configuration values while you are
collecting data. It will confound the results. Either delete the
data files, or switch to another folder.
<p>
The configuration variables are stored in a separate initialization file in
the same location as this program.

<h3> Internals </h3>

The program is quite simple. For each exercise there is an
abc template. For example the template for the high/low exercise
is here.

<pre>

X:1
T: pitch discrim
M: 4/4
L: 1/4
K: C
Q: 1/4 = $tempo
%%MIDI program $prog
$note z |$shift$note|

</pre>

The variables tempo, prog, note, and shift are set by
the program and are substituted into the file to create
an abc file tmp.abc. A simple procedure out_and_play(abcfile)
converts the abc file to a midi file and sends it to the
midi player. Here is the procedure coded in tcl/tk scripting
language.

<pre>
proc out_and_play {abcfile} {
global midi
set outhandle [open tmp.abc w]
puts $outhandle $abcfile
close $outhandle
set cmd1 "exec $midi(abc2midi) tmp.abc"
catch {eval $cmd1} out1
set cmd2 "exec $midi(midiplayer) tmp1.mid "
catch {eval $cmd2} out2
}
</pre>

<p>
There are two functions in the <b>tools</b> menu for exposing
the operation of this program. <b>tools/tmp.abc</b> will display
the contents of the tmp.abc file for the current
trial in a separate window. <b>tools/console</b> shows
the communication between this program with the external
executables.  The console is useful for diagnosing problems
with the program or configurations.



<h3> Epilogue </h3>
Besides your hearing and musical training, the results of this
program depend upon many other factors. The tones are created
by a midi synthesizer, so the soundfont and the characterisitics
of the synthesizer (reverberation, vibrato chorus level, and
etc.) are important. The sound is played by your speakers (or
headphones) at a certain audio level, and there may be ambient
noise in your room. Your sensitivity to pitch differences depends
upon both the pitch and timbre of the tone. Generally, it is
easier to detect pitch differences in the higher octaves.
If the test tone has vibrato, or embedded in a chord with many
overtones, the task is more difficult. A chordal tone above the
test tone may be more salient than the test tone. When you are
collecting data, you should try to keep all these factors fixed.
